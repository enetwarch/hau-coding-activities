# Holy Angel University Coding Activities

This repository is a summation of all the coding activities we have done in [Holy Angel University](https://www.hau.edu.ph/). These activities were designed to help us strengthen out foundation and understanding of programming concepts through the use of practical hands-on tasks. 

## Folder Structure

This is the rough self-explanatory folder structure of the repository. Folders like `/subject` will pertain to the class code and subject abbreviation with `2062-6OOp` as an example. `/year`, `/month`, and `/date` are all in numerical values like `2025`, `06`, and `16` respectively. The naming convention for each directory should be in [`kebab-case`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case).
