# Holy Angel University Coding Activities

This repository is a collection of all the coding activities we have done in [**Holy Angel University**](https://www.hau.edu.ph/). These activities were designed to help us strengthen our foundation and understanding of programming concepts through the use of practical hands-on tasks. All of the files here are **personal solutions** to the given problems from [**HAU Canvas**](https://hau.instructure.com/). Instructions are copy pasted or manually written in the [README.md](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) file of the activity directory.

This is the rough folder structure of the repository. The naming convention for each directory should be in [`kebab-case`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case). The first folders to show up will be the `year level` which is [`year-2`](./year-2/) in this example. Activities will be stored inside their respective subjects and starting date. Folders like `subject` will pertain to the class code and subject abbreviation with [`2062-6oop/`](./year-2/2062-6oop/) as an example. The `year-month-date-number` directory consists of numerical values which should end up like [`2025-06-16-1/`](./year-2/2062-6oop/2025-06-16/), meaning it is an activity that happened on **June 16, 2025**. The last number in the `year-month-date-number` directory indicates the activity number, which in most cases will be **1** because most days will only have one activity.
