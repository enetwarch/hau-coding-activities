          The internet is a vast global network used for searching information, chatting, streaming, shopping, and many
          more. It is deeply integrated in our personal, social, as well as our professional life.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are a vast amount of websites in the world, around 1.13 billion. Even though this number is big, only
          around 18% are active, so only 200 million websites are actually being maintained. This means a large majority
          of websites are just used as archives or old records of the past.
        </li>
        <li>
          The web has 3 fundamental languages which are HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),
          and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure, CSS improves the design and looks, and JavaScript adds
          functionality to the web.
        </li>
        <li>
          The internet is basically just a collection of high speed data highways that are interconnected to provide
          data everywhere. ISPs (Internet Service Providers) let you rent these high speed data highways so you can
          access the web, or anything online.
        </li>
        <li>
          The term webpage and website and often interchanged but they have different meanings. A web page is simply a
          single page of a website while a website is a collection of all of those webpages. Think of a website as a
          book and the webpages are its pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Web design has principles that every web developer or designer should follow to make good looking websites.
          There are many things to take into account, the graphics must be consistent with the brand, the typography
          must be good but readable, the site must be intuitive to navigate around, and many more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Another branch similar to web design is accessibility which has a set of standards (Web Accessibility
          Standards). Accessibility means that a website is usable to normal people, old people, and even people with
          disabilities. It could be in the form of keyboard shortcuts, screen readers, or many others.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are many web development languages and frameworks like JavaScript, PHP, Node.js, Laravel, React, etc..
          But from my experience, anything can be used in web development these days due to the abundance of frameworks
          in various languages, whether it be for backend or even frontend with Wasm (WebAssembly).
        </li>
        <li>
          Code editors exist to help developers code as it provides many features that help reduce pain points of
          programming. One of these features is IntelliSense, which helps with autocomplete, error detection, syntax
          mistakes, and many more. Keyboard shortcuts are another thing, allowing developers to edit multiple lines at
          the same time as an example.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are many types of sites such as: e-commerce, blogs, media, social network, game, and many others. Each
          of them provide services or data to the user one way or another and can sometimes earn money through traffic
          and ads. Some websites are heavy on the backend while others are just purely frontend.
