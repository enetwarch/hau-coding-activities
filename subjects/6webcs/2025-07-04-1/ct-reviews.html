        <p>
          The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily improving over the last 10 years with fine
          offerings from Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai. Sajja Adulet is to be
          congratulated for offering delicious and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think Curbside Thai
          provides the finest Asian food on or off the streets of Charlotte.

          Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare and we all accept its limitations in exchange for
          the convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you don't have to compromise. Building on his
          experience as a master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast, Sajja Adulet has brought the
          taste of fine dining to the Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.
