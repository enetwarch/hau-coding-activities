        large regions of North Carolina with our mobile food truck, built specially for catering big events.

        Meals are cooked up hot and on the spot at your venue. We have an experienced uniformed catering crew providing
        professional service for events ranging from 50 to 300. We will provide the plates, linens, glassware and other
        dining items, upon request.
