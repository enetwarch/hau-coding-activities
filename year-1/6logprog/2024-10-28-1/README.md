# Final Requirement for 6LOGPROG

Make a group consisting of **4 members**, as for your final requirement in 6LOGPROG, I would like you to apply all concepts from the course (from Prelims to Final Term):

* Variable declaration
* If and If-else statement
* Use of Loops (Repetition Structures)
* Defining and calling a function
* Passing arguments to functions
* Value-returning functions
* and other tackled topics.

As a group, **I would like to see how you guys created the code by explaining it through video recording**

There are 10 groups expected, if your group # is odd number, choose question #1, then if your group # is even, choose question #2

## Question #1 (Group 1, 3, 5, 7, 9)	

**Write a program that allows users to add items to their shopping cart, remove them, and view the total cost.**

## Question #2 (Group 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

**Write a program that allows users to play rock-paper-scissors against the computer.**

For Submission, I would only require 1 submission per group, indicating your group members, comment them inside your code; place the submission of files inside a zip folder (**.py file, Screenshot of output and the Video Recording**) with the file name format - **FINAL-REQUIREMENT-6LOGPROG-GROUP #.zip**

**If somebody in your group did not contribute to your project, please message me directly, do not hesitate to do so :)**

As a rubric for the scoring of the project:

* 5pts - Use of functions to encapsulate code
* 5pts - Use of conditional statements and loops to control the flow of execution
* 5pts - Storing data in a structured format (e.g., dictionaries, lists)
* 5pts - Performing arithmetic operations on numbers
* 5pts - Generating random numbers or choices
* 15pts - Implementing game logic/definition of Functions (e.g., rock-paper-scissors)
