# Performing Calculations

Write the corresponding code for each problem. Save and upload the code for each problem. Upload a screenshot of your code with corresponding outputs (Python Shell).

## Scoring Guide

* Code produces correct output by using correct operators.
* Code meets problem requirements.
* Code follow good programming practice.

Each item will be scored 10 points each.

## Problems

1. Write a program that will require the user to input integer values for x, y and z. Display the result after evaluating the mathematical expression:

![Formula](./docs/formula.png)

Convert the given expression into a valid python statement. Format the result with 2 decimal places. Save the file as **Performing Calculations1.py**

### Sample Output:
```
Input value for x: 1
Input value for y: 2
Input value for z: 3
Result: 54.17
```

2. Write a program that will display the pay slip of an employee. Input the name of the Employee, the number of regular hours worked per week, overtime hours and the hourly rate. Display the gross pay, which is the total number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate. Overtime rate per hour is 25% more than the regular hourly rate. The overtime pay is also added to the gross pay.  Deductions on the gross pay include 12% income tax applied on the gross pay, cooperative shares of 3.5% of gross pay and union dues of 135 pesos. Display the value of each deduction as well as total deduction. Finally, print he net pay, which is the difference of the gross and deductions. Save the file as **Performing Calculations2.py**

### Sample Output 1:

```
Weekly Pay Slip
Employee Name: Jose Maria
Regular Hours Worked: 40
Overtime Hours: 3
Hourly Rate: 225.50
Gross Pay: P 9,865.62
Deductions: 
        Income Tax: P 1,183.88
        Cooperative Shares: P 345.30
        Union Dues: P 135.00
        Total : P 1,664.17
Net Pay: P 8,201.45
```

### Sample Output 2:

```
Weekly Pay Slip
Employee Name: Jose Maria
Total Hours Worked: 40
Overtime Hours: 0
Hourly Rate: 225.50
Gross Pay: P 9,020.00
Deductions: 
        Income Tax: P 1,082.40
        Cooperative Shares: P 315.70
        Union Dues: P 135.00
        Total : P 1,533.10
Net Pay: P 7,486.90
```

3. As a trainer for track and field, the athlete that you are training has a speed that can be expressed as x+3 kph which can cover a distance of x2 + 5x + 6 km. You need to find the time in order to gather data that will be helpful in your training. What will be the time elapsed in hours base on the inputted value of x (accepts values with decimal points) ?  Save the file as Performing Calculations3.py

### Sample Output: 

```
Input value of x : 5
Time elapsed: 7.00 hrs
```
