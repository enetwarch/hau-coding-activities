# Decision Structure: Single alternative

Write the corresponding python code for each problem. Save and upload the code and a screenshot of your outputs for each problem. Always include your full name and section in the code as a comment.

## Scoring Guide

* Code produces correct output by using correct operators.
* Code meets problem requirements.
* Code follow good programming practice.

**You are only allowed to use single alternative if statement.**

## Problems

1. Write a program that will compute for the jeepney fare based on the following conditions:

First 4 kilometers will be charged 13.00 pesos and succeeding kilometers will be charged an additional of 1.50 pesos. Amount is only increased for each full kilometer.  Ask the user to input the distance traveled in kilometers.  Before paying, the user will be asked if they are eligible for discount, if yes, the fare will be discounted 20%. Display the total fare. The user will also input the payment, if there is a change, the program will also display the change. Save as **DS1.py**

Consider the following sample outputs. Please take note that these are sample input values and corresponding outputs to verify your design.

### Sample 1:

```
Distance Travelled: 3.5
Student/Senior/PWD(yes/no): no
Total fare: 13.00 pesos
Payment: 13.00
```

### Sample 2:

```
Distance Travelled: 5
Student/Senior/PWD(yes/no): no
Total fare: 14.50 pesos
Payment: 15.00
Change: 0.50 pesos
```

### Sample 3:

```
Distance Travelled: 5.5
Student/Senior/PWD(yes/no): no
Total fare: 14.50 pesos
Payment: 20.00
Change: 5.50 pesos
```

### Sample 4:

```
Distance Travelled: 5.5
Student/Senior/PWD(yes/no): yes
Total fare: 11.60 pesos
Payment: 20.00
Change: 8.40 pesos
```
